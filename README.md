ECC Secure Payment System
Welcome to the ECC Secure Payment System
This project utilizes Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to enable secure payments. ECC is a public-key encryption technique based on elliptic curve theory that can create faster, smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Key Generation: Each user generates a public and private key pair.
Transaction Signing: Transactions are signed using the sender's private key.
Signature Verification: The transaction is verified using the sender's public key.
This ensures that only the owner of the private key can initiate a transaction, providing a high level of security.
